Quick collaboration work to nail down our use cases with the foreman

# Pre-workflows

- EngOps registers baremetal via ISO (when racking new hardware)
    - burn iso
    - boot machine with iso
    - via cd, foreman discovers machine and creates foreman host record
- discovery in foreman
- discovery via manageiq (no)

- assign ipmi (iDrac - dell's ipmi hardware)
- assign primary interface: mac
- assign os architecture

# Foreman setup (DevOps)
# Hostgroup contains:
#   environment, puppet ca, puppet master, network/domain
#   it will optionally store: os (os family), media, partition table
# subnet


# Provision Bare metal (User)

- Catalog
    + pxe: ->
        + Host Group (ipxe, provision)
        + OS
- Customize:
    + root password
    + host name
    + ip address
    + subnet choice (contains gateway, dns)
    + template
        + medium
        + ptable

# workflows for another day

## inventory

- get list of all foreman hosts
- determine if we already have a vm for that host record / link them

## register VM via ManageIq (at provisioning time)

- we create VM in VMWare
    - via rest protocol create foreman host record
    - set primary interface mac address
